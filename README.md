Through the Trip-Based Modelling of Fuel Consumption in Modern Fleet Vehicles Using Machine Learning initiative,
fleet managers may optimise vehicle usage and cut expenses by predicting fuel consumption based on trip data. 
The project uses machine learning to provide predictions and insights based on data in order to maximize fuel economy and reduce environmental impact.
